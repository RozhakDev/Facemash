### Features In Script?

- The script is made 100% using **GraphQL** or **https://web.facebook.com.**
- Working method and very complete.
- Generates a random user-agent.
- Form data in a complete script to avoid spam.

### Get Success Results?

- Use good methods like **MBASIC, FREE, D.FACEBOOK.COM, WEB.**
- Use recommended providers such as **INDOSAT, AXIS.**
- Find a good target in the recommended **"Crack Dari Member Group"** and look for a Facebook group that has a lot of new account members.
- Use a good user-agent like **REALME, OPPO, SAMSUNG, ONEPLUS, POCO, XIAOMI, HUAWEI, VIVO.**

### Why No Results?

- You chose the wrong password list, it is recommended to use a password such as **DEFAULT, LENGKAP** or number **01, 02.**
- You don't turn on **"Airplane Mode"** every 200 usernames.
- IP addresses are blocked or spammed.
- Your target has a difficult password or is not on the list.

### Why My Account Is Checkpoint?

**Solution :**
- Facebook accounts come with a phone number, email, and two-factor authentication.
- The Facebook account is online in the browser to retrieve cookies.
- Open **"https://web.facebook.com"** in desktop mode during Dump and refresh every few minutes.

### Why Dump Failed?

- You enter the wrong target, make sure to check before dumping.
- Maybe your facebook account got spammed or temporarily blocked for 24 hours.
- Maybe your Facebook account is locked or hit by a checkpoint.

### Why Checkpoint Results?

**Factor :**
- I'm sure that all the checkpoint results are affected by the target.
- The user-agent or method doesn't match in the target.
- Maybe the provider used is not suitable for executing the target.
