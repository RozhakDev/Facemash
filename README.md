### Description
**[Facemash](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTI4ODI1MTk3NzAyNzIw?story_media_id=3122076630454228803_5398218083)** is a script to get a Facebook account that has an easy password. This script was released January 1, 2023, which is the final and newest version of Facebook.

**Facemash** is not a main script because it is only a complement to the [Instagram](https://github.com/RozhakXD/Premium) script which is the main parent of this script. All features will be perfect in the Instagram script.

### Target Requirements On Dump?

- **Likes**: Must have at least 1000 likes, not the most popular post recommended from the homepage, and not a post from the cover photo or profile photo.
- **Friends :** Must have more than 300 friends, be visible to the public, and not be a professional account.
- **Group**: Must have members and the group is not private.
- **Followers**: Must have more than 500 followers and not be a professional account.

### Get Success Results?

- You have to look for a target that has a new account and make sure the target is good or has a bad password.
- Use good methods like **MBASIC, DEFAULT, MESSENGER LITE.**
- Use recommended providers such as **INDOSAT, AXIS.**
- I recommend that you look for targets in the same area as you.
- Use a good user-agent like **REALME, OPPO, SAMSUNG, ONEPLUS, POCO, XIAOMI, HUAWEI, VIVO.**

### Why No Results?

- You chose the wrong password list, it is recommended to use a password such as **DEFAULT, LENGKAP** or number **01, 02.**
- Your target has a difficult password or no one has an easy password.
- You don't turn on **"Airplane Mode"** every 200 usernames.
- Your IP address is being blocked or spammed.
- The Facebook system is having problems causing no crack results.
- I think if there are no results at all it is your target that is the problem.

### Why My Account Is Checkpoint?

**Solution :**
- I hope that if your account is hit by a checkpoint, you have to open it so that the account lasts longer.
- Use a fake account or a newly created account.
- Facebook accounts come with a phone number, email, and two-factor authentication.
- The Facebook account is online in the browser to retrieve cookies.
- Open **"https://web.facebook.com"** in desktop mode during Dump and refresh every few minutes.

### Why Dump Failed?

- I also think your Facebook account must have been blocked for dumping for 24 hours or spammed.
- Maybe your Facebook account has been checkpointed or temporarily locked.
- The target you entered is not correct. Make sure you check whether the target meets the requirements.

### I only get Checkpoints?

- The target you entered has already executed someone.
- Your provider is not suitable for this script.
- The target you entered is not good or you are unlucky.
- Inappropriate selection of method and user-agent.
